        <p>Ravenshaw is the oldest institution of higher
            education in the state of Odisha and one of the oldest institutions of higher education in India. It was
            founded in 1868 with intermediate level (F. A.) classes at the Cuttack Zilla (district) School (now
            Ravenshaw Collegiate School). The high school, which was also known as the Cuttack High School, was elevated
            to a first grade college in 1876. It became widely known as Cuttack College until it was rechristened
            Ravenshaw College as a tribute to T. E. Ravenshaw, who was the Commissioner of Cuttack Division and had
            played a key role in its creation. The office of Ravenshaw College and Ravenshaw Collegiate School was
            separated in 1904.

            <br> The site in which Ravenshaw is presently located was selected as a site for the College by the Nathan
            Committe in 1913.<a class="underline" href="pdf/pdf 1.pdf"> Ravenshaw College Map first draft reproduced
                from Nivedita M.’s Ravenshaw College:
                Orissa’s Temple of Learning, 1868-2006; Building plan</a> Back then, the site was populary called Chakra
            Padia
            which was a race course at the time. According to popular lore, it was a lonely and unsafe place. However,
            newspaper reports of the time provide accounts of how Chakra Padia was the preferred site of the English
            officers in Cuttack for festivities and sports. Besides horse racing and cricket matches which were the
            usual sporting events, it was the women’s cycle race which drew great attention.</br>

            <br>If a strategic shift in favour of the spread of ‘modern’ education and ‘development’ by building an
            institution of higher education like Ravenshaw in the wake of a catastrophic famine of 1866 characterized
            the focus of colonial policy interventionism in nineteenth century Odisha, the ‘expressivist’ signs of the
            institution were marked by a subversive spirit of anti-colonialism suffused with a radical libertarian
            ideological position in the first half of the twentieth century <a class="underline"

                            words of Sir Edward Gait, Lt. Governor of Bihar-Orissa Province, who, while laying the

                            stone of Ravenshaw College on 11 November 1919, had wished for a “separate University with

                            own

                        <p align="Justify">Ravenshaw College was affiliated to Calcutta University in 1876. But the
                            affiliation was
                            restricted for a limited number of courses such as English, Vernacular Composition,
                            Sanskrit,
                            Persian, Logic, Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics, Chemistry and Botany. The affiliation of
                            the
                            College was transferred to Patna University on 1 October 1917. For the first time officers
                            of
                            Indian Educational Service (IES) grade were assigned to Ravenshaw College. New faculty
                            arrived
                            and teaching and research activities gained momentum. Amid the outbreak of World War I and
                            later
                            the Non-cooperation movement, the College continued to provide a stimulating environment for
                            the
                            young students. The faculty and students were immersed in the activities of the college as
                            well
                            as social causes. A number of magazines came to be published, the most popular of which was

                            residential

                        <p align="Justify">Soon, Ravenshaw College, because of the activities of its faculty and
                            students,
                            became a driving
                            force in the civic and political life of the state of Orissa. The famous literary movement
                            called Sabuja juga was born through the writings of young students (of the College) such as
                            Annadashankar Roy, Kalindicharan panigrahi, Baikunthanath Patnaik, Saratchandra Mukherjee
                            and
                            Harihar Mahapatra; the Utkal Sahitya Samaj often had faculty members of Ravenshaw College as
                            speakers; the great Professor Jogesh Chandra Ray, who introduced Samanta Chandra Sekhar’s
                            great
                            work, the astronomical treatise Siddhanta Darpana to the world, was honoured by the oldest
                            learned society of Odisha, the Puri Mukti Mandap which conferred on him the title
                            ‘Vidyanidhi’.

                        <p align="Justify">When Ravenshaw College celebrated its golden jubilee in 1926, it already had
                            a
                            band of loyal
                            Ravenshavians who, in adoration of their experiences of their alma mater, got together to
                            form
                            an Old Boys’ Association. Hostel life, which began with the establishment of the East, West
                            and
                            Muhammadan hostels, added glamour to the life of the students who were infused with the
                            spirit
                            of camaraderie. The students of Ravenshaw College were looked upon as a class of first
                            citizens
                            of sorts who could play an important role in building up a strong Orissa province, and so
                            they
                            did. The students reached out to the society in various ways: through the activities of the
                            Social Service Guild, they volunteered to teach at the Adult (Evening) School, coordinated
                            and
                            conducted relief work during the floods in Orissa, formed a Cremation Association to take
                            charge
                            of the cremation of dead bodies.</p>
                        <p align="Justify">Ravenshaw College celebrated its Diamond Jubilee on 18 January 1936. On 1
                            April
                            1936, the new
                            province of Orissa came into being. It was in the Ravenshaw College Hall (now called
                            Heritage
                            Hall) that Sir John Austin Hubback was administered the oath of office of the Governor of
                            Orissa. In the euphoria that followed, new practices of community and social life were
                            introduced which gave a distinct character to Ravenshaw College. The first Provincial Durbar
                            was
                            held in the College Hall on 9 January 1937. Soon after, the first Legislative Assembly of
                            Orissa
                            started operating from the College Hall from 28 July 1937. Ravenshaw College had become the
                            symbol of a young vibrant State and for the whole year of 1937, the College played host to
                            several high-profile gatherings, festivities and celebrations. When the Assembly was in
                            session,
                            the legislative members shared rooms with the students in the hostels. Understandably, the
                            young
                            students were inspired and soon founded a ‘mock assembly’ and conducted regular sessions.

                            agitation, the

                            arrived.
                            Among the new women faculty were the distinguished teachers such as Mrs. Padma Sundaram

                            and Prof. Gaurirani Ghosh (Botany). The students of Ravenshaw College, inspired by

                            fervour and democratic ideals, started taking active part in politics. The Ravenshaw College
                            Students’ Union was born around the time. Political heavyweights such as Subhash Bose and
                            Sarojini Naidu addressed the students of Ravenshaw College on different occasions, inspiring
                            the
                            students to participate in several political protests organised during the freedom movement.

                            <p align="Justify" style=" margin-right: 52vh;">It was when Ravenshaw College was affiliated
                                to
                                Calcutta University. Striving to take forward
                                the movement for Oriya language, three young Ravenshavians founded an organization
                                called
                                “Kartabya Bodhini”. They were Gopabandhu Das, Lokanath Patnaik and Brajasundar Das.
                                While
                                Gopabandhu and Lokanath were students of B.A. in Ravenshaw College, Brajasundar was
                                doing
                                B.A. in Presidency College. The University authorities, to further the cause of Bengali
                                language, decided that a student sitting for the B.A. examination would have to write an
                                essay in Bengali. To honour the successful student, his name along with a star mark
                                beside
                                it would be featured in the gazette. Kartabya Bodhini rose up in revolt against this
                                unfair
                                rule. A generous Sir John Woodburn, who was the rector of Calcutta University, took
                                cognizance of the complaint letter sent by Kartabya Bodhini and approved a separate
                                question
                                in Oriya for Oriya students taking the B.A. examination. Lokanath Patnaik and Gopabandhu
                                Das
                                were the first to take the examination in the new system. They were confident of passing
                                the
                                exam with good marks. But, in fact, they had failed. The question setter and the
                                evaluator
                                for their papers was Madhusudan Rao. Brajasundar, by then, had already passed the B.A.
                                course from Presidency College. To find out why his friends had failed, Brajasundar met
                                Rao,
                                who said that he had given them a total of 33 marks. But the University authorities had,

                                the meanwhile, raised the pass marks to 50, thus pushing out the students from the pass
                                list. Gopabandhu Das and Lokanath Patnaik, thus, had the good luck of staying back in

                                fresh
                                from school, arrives at the Cuttack Railway
                                station. There, he is received by his maternal uncle Dibya Singha Misra who was a person

                                eminence in those days. Just then Gopabandhu Babu gets down from the train and modestly
                                greets Misra who was his teacher. Misra introduces his nephew to Gopabandhu Babu with

                                pride, for the boy had passed the matriculation in the first division and was likely to

                                schools run by the alien government.” The reply stung Misra and robbed the young boy of

                                hallucinations. The boy, nonetheless, went on to join Ravenshaw and rose in life to

                                father be present when he cleared her doubts in the after-class hours. In the classroom,

                                seat was always near the teacher’s desk. This saved her from the boys’ pranks but caused

                                <br> The College magazine Ravenshavian started in 1916. Prof. P.S. Sundaram (former
                                Sonepur
                                Professor of English, Ravenshaw College) recollects how exciting it was “to do a little
                                research in the history of the college, … get all the back numbers together, correct the
                                mistakes in their enumeration, and get them bound in sizeable volumes for consultation
                                in
                                the College library.” While the Ravenshavian attracted a lot of contributions, some of
                                which
                                had to be tactfully put aside, the Ravenshaw College Weekly hardly received a
                                contribution.
                                According to Prof. Sundaram, until Mr. V. V. John joined the College in 1940,
                                “practically
                                all the eight columns of the Weekly had to be written or rewritten by the Editor.” Time
                                and
                                again, the Weekly was pronounced dead. However, it remained active for a brief period
                                when
                                it carried the news of the World War, highlighting the victories of the Allied Powers
                                and
                                castigating Hitler. Finally, the Weekly did die.</br>

                                <br> Soon after the death of the Weekly, Mr. V. V. John started The Wheel as “an Organ
                                of
                                University Life in Orissa.” It ran from November 1948 to April 1949. The Wheel
                                ventilated
                                “one’s grief and indignation at cows destroying the College lawn, men and women having
                                to
                                draw up water from a well without a pulley, and sundry other daily chores and
                                vexations.” At
                                the same time, it took up cudgels “against the highest of the land—Chief Justices and
                                such
                                like, who went out of their way to sneer at it—and had to be stopped so that the powers
                                that
                                be might not be offended.”</br>

                                <br>The first issue of the Ravenshaw College Calendar saw the light of the day in July
                                1940.
                                The
                                Government had no money to print such a calendar, when, as a godsend, a sum of Rs. 500
                                arrived as a discretionary grant from the Governor, Sir John Hubback.</br>

                                <br> Prof. Sundaram recounts his days and nights in the Kanika Library where, he, with
                                the
                                help
                                of the Librarian Damodar Misra and some students and several others arranged the books
                                according to the Dewey Decimal System, much to the chagrin of the librarian, who called

                                all dewy and foggy. When the catalogue was printed in 1939, it listed a minimum of 7000
                                books.</br>
