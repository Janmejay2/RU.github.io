            “The Seven Pillars of Wisdom” was the brainchild of the former Vice-Chancellor Mr. Devdas Chhotray, who
            called upon the goodwill of his friend and architect Mr. Rajan Saklani to oversee the whole range of works
            from drawing and design to the execution of the plan. The design of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom was inspired
            by Mr. Chhotray’s reading of T. E. Lawrence’s autobiography Seven Pillars of Wisdom.<br><br>
