            (Knowledge
            is power), Ravenshaw University aims to preserve its position as the “temple of learning”, with a deep
            knowing that the phrase exists in the vernacular for a reason. The university envisions itself as the
            one-stop destination for higher education for students from diverse social and economic backgrounds, and
